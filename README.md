<kbd>-></kbd> or <kbd>d</kbd>: move the object drawn one unit in the positive x direction

<kbd><-</kbd> or <kbd>a</kbd>: move the object drawn one unit in the negative x direction
<kbd>/\</kbd> or <kbd>w</kbd>: move the object drawn one unit in the negative z direction
<kbd>\/</kbd> or <kbd>s</kbd>: move the object drawn one unit in the positive z direction
<kbd>x</kbd>: rotate the object drawn 90 degrees counterclockwise around the x axis
<kbd>X</kbd>: rotate the object drawn 90 degrees clockwise around the x axis
<kbd>y</kbd>: rotate the object drawn 90 degrees counterclockwise around the y axis
<kbd>Y</kbd>: rotate the object drawn 90 degrees clockwise around the y axis
<kbd>z</kbd>: rotate the object drawn 90 degrees counterclockwise around the z axis
<kbd>Z</kbd>: rotate the object drawn 90 degrees clockwise around the z axis
<kbd>p</kbd>: (un)pause the game (i.e. stop/restart gravity) It pauses only gravity and mouse camera movement.
<kbd>g</kbd>: enable/ disable grid
